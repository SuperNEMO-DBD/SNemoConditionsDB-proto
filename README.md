# SNemoConditionsDB-proto
Example of a GitCondDB conditions database for several time varying
"conditions". 

The example given here uses some dumb slow control like data, and
uses arbitrary IOV time points. These are purely to demo that we
can vary quantities over time.

The _tag_ dimension is again arbitrary. It shows an "API" change as
a name change to the parameters in the conditions file.
